# Usage
- Easy! `Ctrl + p` to open the command prompt, find the "Serendipity: Open Note Without Link" and press enter.

# What does it do? And why?
- Opens a random, unlinked note from your vault.
- The stock "open random note" is nice! It's like flipping through TV channels to see what's on.
- This is a bit different in that it shows you what you haven't been thinking about lately, or what's _not_ on your mind at present.
- Get in touch with your shadow you! Or the thoughts of yester-you ❤️❤️❤️

# Manual installation
- _Brave soul; you have my eternal gratitude_
- Very simple! Download the files to the plugins folder (`NAME_OF_YOUR_VAULT/.obsidian/plugins`) using `git clone https://github.com/doomdagadiggiedahdah/obsidian-serendipity.git`
- Go into the directory and run `npm install` followed by `npm run dev` (you can cancel that after it's run) now go to your Vault
- Finally, go to Settings > Community Plugins and look under "Installed Plugins". `Serendipity` should be an entry that you can toggle on.
- Now test out the command!
