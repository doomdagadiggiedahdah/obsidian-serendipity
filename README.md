# Usage
- Easy! `Ctrl + p` to open the command prompt, find the "Future randUnconn: Open Note Without Link" and press enter.

# What does it do? And why?
- Opens a random, unlinked note from your vault.
- The stock "open random note" is nice! It's like flipping through TV channels to see what's on.
- This is a bit different in that it shows you what you haven't been thinking about lately, or what's _not_ on your mind at present.
- Get in touch with your shadow you! Or the thoughts of yester-you ❤️❤️❤️
